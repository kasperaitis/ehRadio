This is ehRadio, an ESP32 project that plays Internet radio streams
ehRadio is based on yoRadio
ehRadio is hosted at https://github.com/trip5/ehRadio/
yoRadio is hosted at https://github.com/e2002/yoradio/
I made the new project because I was making submissions to yoRadio but the original author (e2002) did not accept my PRs
I regularly try to update ehRadio based on improvements to yoRadio
The current codebase is now a mess because I've been trying to absorb e2002's changes at the same time as making my own improvements
The decoding of audio codecs is based on an improvement by maleksm (resource not available)
